-- =====================================================
-- SETUP: CREATE BACKUP AND SAMPLE DATA
-- =====================================================

-- First, let's create backups of our important tables
SELECT * INTO CustomersBackup_DeleteExamples FROM SampleCustomers;
SELECT * INTO ProductsBackup_DeleteExamples FROM SampleProducts;
SELECT * INTO OrdersBackup_DeleteExamples FROM SampleOrders;

-- Create some test data specifically for deletion examples
INSERT INTO SampleCustomers (FirstName, LastName, Email, CustomerType, IsActive)
VALUES 
    ('Delete', 'Test1', 'delete1@test.com', 'Test', 0),
    ('Delete', 'Test2', 'delete2@test.com', 'Test', 0),
    ('Delete', 'Test3', 'delete3@test.com', 'Test', 1),
    ('Temp', 'User1', 'temp1@test.com', 'Temporary', 1),
    ('Temp', 'User2', 'temp2@test.com', 'Temporary', 1);

-- Create a temporary table for deletion practice
CREATE TABLE TempLogs (
    LogID INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    LogMessage VARCHAR(255),
    LogDate DATETIME DEFAULT GETDATE(),
    LogLevel VARCHAR(20),
    IsProcessed BIT DEFAULT 0
);

INSERT INTO TempLogs (LogMessage, LogLevel, LogDate, IsProcessed)
VALUES 
    ('System started', 'INFO', DATEADD(DAY, -10, GETDATE()), 1),
    ('Error occurred', 'ERROR', DATEADD(DAY, -9, GETDATE()), 1),
    ('User login', 'INFO', DATEADD(DAY, -8, GETDATE()), 1),
    ('System error', 'ERROR', DATEADD(DAY, -7, GETDATE()), 0),
    ('Debug message', 'DEBUG', DATEADD(DAY, -6, GETDATE()), 0),
    ('Warning issued', 'WARN', DATEADD(DAY, -5, GETDATE()), 0),
    ('Recent log entry', 'INFO', DATEADD(HOUR, -2, GETDATE()), 0);

PRINT 'Setup complete. Sample data and backups created.';

-- =====================================================
-- SAFE DELETE METHODOLOGY
-- =====================================================

-- Example 1: The proper way to delete - test first!

-- STEP 1: Always test your WHERE clause with SELECT first
SELECT LogID, LogMessage, LogLevel, LogDate, IsProcessed
FROM TempLogs 
WHERE LogLevel = 'DEBUG' AND IsProcessed = 1;

-- STEP 2: Count how many records will be deleted
SELECT COUNT(*) AS RecordsToDelete
FROM TempLogs 
WHERE LogLevel = 'DEBUG' AND IsProcessed = 1;

-- STEP 3: If the count looks right, proceed with DELETE
DELETE FROM TempLogs 
WHERE LogLevel = 'DEBUG' AND IsProcessed = 1;

-- STEP 4: Check how many were actually deleted
SELECT @@ROWCOUNT AS RecordsDeleted;

-- STEP 5: Verify the deletion worked as expected
SELECT COUNT(*) AS RemainingDebugRecords
FROM TempLogs 
WHERE LogLevel = 'DEBUG';

-- =====================================================
-- BASIC DELETE EXAMPLES
-- =====================================================

-- Example 2: Simple single record deletion
-- Delete a specific test customer
DELETE FROM SampleCustomers 
WHERE Email = 'delete1@test.com';

PRINT 'Deleted customer with email delete1@test.com';

-- Example 3: Delete multiple records with same condition
-- Delete all inactive test customers
DELETE FROM SampleCustomers 
WHERE CustomerType = 'Test' AND IsActive = 0;

PRINT 'Deleted ' + CAST(@@ROWCOUNT AS VARCHAR(10)) + ' inactive test customers';

-- Example 4: Delete with date condition
-- Delete old processed log entries
DELETE FROM TempLogs 
WHERE LogDate < DATEADD(DAY, -7, GETDATE()) 
  AND IsProcessed = 1;

PRINT 'Deleted ' + CAST(@@ROWCOUNT AS VARCHAR(10)) + ' old processed log entries';

-- =====================================================
-- DELETE WITH DIFFERENT WHERE CONDITIONS
-- =====================================================

-- Example 5: Delete with IN clause
-- Delete multiple specific records
DELETE FROM TempLogs 
WHERE LogLevel IN ('ERROR', 'WARN');

-- Example 6: Delete with LIKE pattern
-- Delete temporary users
DELETE FROM SampleCustomers 
WHERE Email LIKE 'temp%@test.com';

-- Example 7: Delete with NOT EXISTS
-- Delete customers who have never placed orders
DELETE FROM SampleCustomers 
WHERE CustomerType = 'Temporary'
  AND NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM SampleOrders 
      WHERE SampleOrders.CustomerID = SampleCustomers.CustomerID
  );

-- Example 8: Delete with range condition
-- Delete logs from a specific time period
DELETE FROM TempLogs 
WHERE LogDate BETWEEN '2024-10-10' AND '2024-10-15';

-- =====================================================
-- SAFE DELETE WITH TRANSACTIONS
-- =====================================================

-- Example 9: Delete with transaction safety
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Count before deletion
SELECT COUNT(*) AS BeforeCount FROM TempLogs;

-- Perform deletion
DELETE FROM TempLogs 
WHERE LogLevel = 'INFO' AND IsProcessed = 1;

-- Check results
SELECT COUNT(*) AS AfterCount FROM TempLogs;
SELECT @@ROWCOUNT AS DeletedCount;

-- Decision point: commit or rollback
PRINT 'Review the counts above. Uncomment COMMIT or ROLLBACK:';
-- COMMIT TRANSACTION;    -- Uncomment to keep changes
ROLLBACK TRANSACTION;   -- Uncomment to undo changes

-- =====================================================
-- DELETE WITH SUBQUERIES
-- =====================================================

-- Example 10: Delete based on subquery results
-- Create some sample orders first for this example
INSERT INTO SampleOrders (CustomerID, TotalAmount, OrderStatus)
SELECT TOP 3 CustomerID, 50.00, 'Test Order'
FROM SampleCustomers 
WHERE CustomerType != 'Test';

-- Now delete orders for specific customers
DELETE FROM SampleOrders 
WHERE CustomerID IN (
    SELECT CustomerID 
    FROM SampleCustomers 
    WHERE CustomerType = 'Test'
);

-- Example 11: Delete with correlated subquery
-- Delete customers who have only test orders
DELETE FROM SampleCustomers 
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM SampleOrders 
    WHERE SampleOrders.CustomerID = SampleCustomers.CustomerID
      AND OrderStatus = 'Test Order'
)
AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM SampleOrders 
    WHERE SampleOrders.CustomerID = SampleCustomers.CustomerID
      AND OrderStatus != 'Test Order'
);

-- =====================================================
-- CASCADING DELETES AND FOREIGN KEYS
-- =====================================================

-- Example 12: Understanding foreign key constraints
-- This will show what happens when you try to delete referenced data

-- First, let's see what orders exist
SELECT o.OrderID, o.CustomerID, c.FirstName, c.LastName
FROM SampleOrders o
JOIN SampleCustomers c ON o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID;

-- Try to delete a customer who has orders (this should fail)
BEGIN TRY
    DELETE FROM SampleCustomers WHERE CustomerID = 1;
    PRINT 'Customer deleted successfully';
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    PRINT 'Delete failed: ' + ERROR_MESSAGE();
    PRINT 'This is expected due to foreign key constraints';
END CATCH

-- Example 13: Proper way to handle related data
-- Delete in correct order (children first, then parent)

DECLARE @CustomerToDelete INT = 1;

BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- First, delete order details
DELETE FROM SampleOrderDetails 
WHERE OrderID IN (
    SELECT OrderID FROM SampleOrders 
    WHERE CustomerID = @CustomerToDelete
);

-- Then delete orders
DELETE FROM SampleOrders 
WHERE CustomerID = @CustomerToDelete;

-- Finally, delete the customer
DELETE FROM SampleCustomers 
WHERE CustomerID = @CustomerToDelete;

-- Check if all deletions succeeded
IF @@ERROR = 0
BEGIN
    COMMIT TRANSACTION;
    PRINT 'Customer and all related data deleted successfully';
END
ELSE
BEGIN
    ROLLBACK TRANSACTION;
    PRINT 'Delete failed, all changes rolled back';
END

-- =====================================================
-- BULK DELETE OPERATIONS
-- =====================================================

-- Example 14: Batch deletion for large datasets
-- Delete large amounts of data in batches to avoid long locks

-- Repopulate logs for this example
INSERT INTO TempLogs (LogMessage, LogLevel, LogDate, IsProcessed)
SELECT 
    'Batch log ' + CAST(ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY (SELECT NULL)) AS VARCHAR(10)),
    CASE (ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY (SELECT NULL)) % 4)
        WHEN 0 THEN 'DEBUG'
        WHEN 1 THEN 'INFO'
        WHEN 2 THEN 'WARN'
        ELSE 'ERROR'
    END,
    DATEADD(MINUTE, -ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY (SELECT NULL)), GETDATE()),
    1
FROM SampleCustomers c1
CROSS JOIN SampleCustomers c2;  -- Creates many combinations

-- Now delete in batches
DECLARE @BatchSize INT = 10;
DECLARE @RowsDeleted INT = @BatchSize;
DECLARE @TotalDeleted INT = 0;

PRINT 'Starting batch deletion...';

WHILE @RowsDeleted = @BatchSize
BEGIN
    DELETE TOP (@BatchSize) FROM TempLogs 
    WHERE LogLevel = 'DEBUG' AND IsProcessed = 1;
    
    SET @RowsDeleted = @@ROWCOUNT;
    SET @TotalDeleted = @TotalDeleted + @RowsDeleted;
    
    PRINT 'Deleted ' + CAST(@RowsDeleted AS VARCHAR(10)) + ' records in this batch';
    
    -- Small delay to reduce system impact
    WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:00.100';  -- 100ms pause
END

PRINT 'Batch deletion complete. Total deleted: ' + CAST(@TotalDeleted AS VARCHAR(10));

-- =====================================================
-- SOFT DELETE vs HARD DELETE
-- =====================================================

-- Example 15: Implementing soft delete
-- Add columns for soft delete if they don't exist
IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS 
               WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'SampleCustomers' AND COLUMN_NAME = 'IsDeleted')
BEGIN
    ALTER TABLE SampleCustomers ADD IsDeleted BIT DEFAULT 0;
    ALTER TABLE SampleCustomers ADD DeletedDate DATETIME NULL;
    ALTER TABLE SampleCustomers ADD DeletedBy VARCHAR(100) NULL;
END

-- Soft delete example - mark as deleted instead of removing
UPDATE SampleCustomers 
SET IsDeleted = 1,
    DeletedDate = GETDATE(),
    DeletedBy = USER_NAME()
WHERE CustomerType = 'Test';

PRINT 'Soft deleted test customers';

-- Query active customers (excluding soft-deleted)
SELECT CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Email
FROM SampleCustomers 
WHERE IsDeleted = 0 OR IsDeleted IS NULL;

-- Example 16: Hard delete of soft-deleted records
-- After a grace period, permanently remove soft-deleted records
DELETE FROM SampleCustomers 
WHERE IsDeleted = 1 
  AND DeletedDate < DATEADD(DAY, -30, GETDATE());

-- =====================================================
-- DELETE WITH OUTPUT CLAUSE
-- =====================================================

-- Example 17: Capture deleted data for audit purposes
DECLARE @DeletedCustomers TABLE (
    CustomerID INT,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    Email VARCHAR(100),
    DeletedDate DATETIME DEFAULT GETDATE()
);

-- Delete and capture what was deleted
DELETE FROM SampleCustomers 
OUTPUT deleted.CustomerID, deleted.FirstName, deleted.LastName, deleted.Email
INTO @DeletedCustomers (CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Email)
WHERE IsDeleted = 1;

-- Show what was deleted
SELECT * FROM @DeletedCustomers;

-- =====================================================
-- DATA RETENTION POLICIES
-- =====================================================

-- Example 18: Implement automated data retention
-- Delete old data according to retention policies

-- Delete old logs (older than 30 days)
DELETE FROM TempLogs 
WHERE LogDate < DATEADD(DAY, -30, GETDATE());

PRINT 'Deleted logs older than 30 days: ' + CAST(@@ROWCOUNT AS VARCHAR(10));

-- Delete old test orders (older than 7 days)
DELETE FROM SampleOrders 
WHERE OrderStatus = 'Test Order' 
  AND OrderDate < DATEADD(DAY, -7, GETDATE());

-- Example 19: Archive before delete pattern
-- Create archive table
CREATE TABLE ArchivedOrders (
    OrderID INT,
    CustomerID INT,
    OrderDate DATETIME,
    TotalAmount DECIMAL(10,2),
    OrderStatus VARCHAR(20),
    ArchivedDate DATETIME DEFAULT GETDATE()
);

-- Archive old completed orders before deleting
INSERT INTO ArchivedOrders (OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate, TotalAmount, OrderStatus)
SELECT OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate, TotalAmount, OrderStatus
FROM SampleOrders 
WHERE OrderStatus = 'Completed' 
  AND OrderDate < DATEADD(YEAR, -1, GETDATE());

-- Now delete the archived orders from main table
DELETE FROM SampleOrders 
WHERE OrderStatus = 'Completed' 
  AND OrderDate < DATEADD(YEAR, -1, GETDATE());

-- =====================================================
-- ERROR HANDLING AND RECOVERY
-- =====================================================

-- Example 20: Comprehensive error handling for deletes
CREATE PROCEDURE SafeDeleteCustomer
    @CustomerID INT
AS
BEGIN
    SET NOCOUNT ON;
    
    DECLARE @ErrorMessage NVARCHAR(4000);
    DECLARE @RelatedOrders INT;
    
    BEGIN TRY
        -- Validation
        IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM SampleCustomers WHERE CustomerID = @CustomerID)
        BEGIN
            THROW 50001, 'Customer not found', 1;
        END
        
        -- Check for related data
        SELECT @RelatedOrders = COUNT(*)
        FROM SampleOrders 
        WHERE CustomerID = @CustomerID;
        
        IF @RelatedOrders > 0
        BEGIN
            THROW 50002, 'Cannot delete customer with existing orders', 1;
        END
        
        BEGIN TRANSACTION;
        
        -- Perform the deletion
        DELETE FROM SampleCustomers 
        WHERE CustomerID = @CustomerID;
        
        -- Log the deletion
        INSERT INTO TempLogs (LogMessage, LogLevel)
        VALUES ('Customer ' + CAST(@CustomerID AS VARCHAR(10)) + ' deleted', 'INFO');
        
        COMMIT TRANSACTION;
        
        PRINT 'Customer deleted successfully';
        
    END TRY
    BEGIN CATCH
        IF @@TRANCOUNT > 0
            ROLLBACK TRANSACTION;
            
        SET @ErrorMessage = ERROR_MESSAGE();
        PRINT 'Delete failed: ' + @ErrorMessage;
        
        -- Log the error
        INSERT INTO TempLogs (LogMessage, LogLevel)
        VALUES ('Customer deletion failed: ' + @ErrorMessage, 'ERROR');
    END CATCH
END

-- Test the safe delete procedure
EXEC SafeDeleteCustomer @CustomerID = 999;  -- Non-existent customer

-- =====================================================
-- PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS
-- =====================================================

-- Example 21: Efficient deletion strategies

-- Create index for faster deletions (if it doesn't exist)
IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.indexes WHERE name = 'IX_TempLogs_LogDate')
BEGIN
    CREATE INDEX IX_TempLogs_LogDate ON TempLogs(LogDate);
END

-- Efficient deletion using indexed column
DELETE FROM TempLogs 
WHERE LogDate < '2024-10-01';  -- Uses index on LogDate

-- Example 22: Avoid inefficient deletions
-- BAD: Function on column prevents index use
-- DELETE FROM TempLogs WHERE YEAR(LogDate) = 2023;

-- GOOD: Range condition that can use index
DELETE FROM TempLogs 
WHERE LogDate >= '2023-01-01' AND LogDate < '2024-01-01';

-- =====================================================
-- TRUNCATE vs DELETE
-- =====================================================

-- Example 23: When to use TRUNCATE instead of DELETE

-- TRUNCATE: Fast way to delete ALL rows (no WHERE clause allowed)
-- Creates a temporary table to demonstrate
CREATE TABLE #TruncateDemo (
    ID INT IDENTITY(1,1),
    Data VARCHAR(50)
);

INSERT INTO #TruncateDemo (Data) VALUES ('Test1'), ('Test2'), ('Test3');

-- TRUNCATE removes all rows very quickly
TRUNCATE TABLE #TruncateDemo;

-- Check that it's empty and identity is reset
SELECT COUNT(*) AS RecordCount FROM #TruncateDemo;

-- Insert new data to see identity reset
INSERT INTO #TruncateDemo (Data) VALUES ('After Truncate');
SELECT * FROM #TruncateDemo;  -- ID starts at 1 again

DROP TABLE #TruncateDemo;

-- Example 24: DELETE vs TRUNCATE comparison
PRINT 'DELETE vs TRUNCATE:';
PRINT 'DELETE: Can use WHERE clause, slower, can be rolled back, keeps identity sequence';
PRINT 'TRUNCATE: No WHERE clause, very fast, resets identity, minimal logging';

-- =====================================================
-- VERIFICATION AND CLEANUP
-- =====================================================

-- Example 25: Verify deletions and check data integrity

-- Check remaining data counts
SELECT 'Table Counts After Deletions' AS Category;
SELECT 'SampleCustomers' AS TableName, COUNT(*) AS RecordCount FROM SampleCustomers
UNION ALL
SELECT 'SampleOrders', COUNT(*) FROM SampleOrders
UNION ALL
SELECT 'TempLogs', COUNT(*) FROM TempLogs;

-- Check for orphaned records
SELECT 'Orphaned Records Check' AS Category;
SELECT 'Orders without customers' AS Issue, COUNT(*) AS Count
FROM SampleOrders o
LEFT JOIN SampleCustomers c ON o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
WHERE c.CustomerID IS NULL
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Order details without orders', COUNT(*)
FROM SampleOrderDetails od
LEFT JOIN SampleOrders o ON od.OrderID = o.OrderID
WHERE o.OrderID IS NULL;

-- =====================================================
-- RESTORE FROM BACKUP (If needed)
-- =====================================================

-- Example 26: How to restore from backup if you made a mistake

-- Check current state
SELECT COUNT(*) AS CurrentCustomerCount FROM SampleCustomers;

-- If you need to restore (uncomment these lines):
/*
-- Restore customers from backup
DELETE FROM SampleCustomers;  -- Clear current data
INSERT INTO SampleCustomers (CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Email, Phone, DateJoined, IsActive, CustomerType)
SELECT CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Email, Phone, DateJoined, IsActive, CustomerType
FROM CustomersBackup_DeleteExamples;

PRINT 'Customers restored from backup';
*/

-- =====================================================
-- CLEANUP - REMOVE EXAMPLE DATA AND BACKUPS
-- =====================================================

-- Clean up our example objects
DROP TABLE TempLogs;
DROP TABLE ArchivedOrders;
DROP PROCEDURE SafeDeleteCustomer;

-- Clean up backup tables (uncomment if you want to remove backups)
/*
DROP TABLE CustomersBackup_DeleteExamples;
DROP TABLE ProductsBackup_DeleteExamples;
DROP TABLE OrdersBackup_DeleteExamples;
*/

-- =====================================================
-- KEY LEARNING POINTS SUMMARY
